Make a program to read the data of N taxpayers (N provided by the user), which can be individuals or company entities and then show the amount of tax paid by each one as well as the total tax collected.

Individuals data are name, annual income and health expenditures. Company entity data are name, annual income and number of employees. The rules for calculating tax are as follows:

* Individuals: persons whose income was below 20000.00 pay 15%  tax. Persons income from 20000.00 onwards pay 25%. If the person had health expenditures, 50% of these expenses are deducted from the tax. 

* Companies: Legal entities pay 16% tax. However, if the company has more than 10 employees, it pays 14% tax.
